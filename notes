All notable ECC points and scalars should use two or three letter identifiers.
The first letter is capital to indicate that it is a point.
The first letter is lowercase to indicate that it is a scalar.

NOTE: Go uses capital and lowercase to determine if a variable or function in a package is exportable.
This may potentially introduce a conflict where it is desirable to start the variable with a capital
to indicate that it is a point, but also desirable to start it with lowercase to keep it non-exportable
or vice versa.

All "keys" are two or three characters: kx, kxx, Kx, or Kxx where xx is an abbreviated identifier

k implies a private key (scalar)
K implies a public key (point)

e.g.

kfr = private find received key
Kfr = public find received key

Ktx = transaction public key

ksp = private spend key
Ksp = public spend key

Kss = shared secret

Ko = one time address
ko = one time address private key

similarly use hxx and Hxx for hash to scalar and hash to point results
